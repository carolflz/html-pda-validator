# html-pda-validator
A modern GUI-based HTML tag validator built with **Tkinter** and powered by **Pushdown Automaton (PDA) simulation**. This tool highlights mismatched tags, visualizes structure errors, and provides a tag usage analysis table â€” perfect for beginners learning HTML and students studying automata theory.

**How It Works: HTML Tag Validator using PDA**
This project simulates a Pushdown Automaton (PDA) to validate the structure of HTML documents. PDAs are commonly used in compiler design to recognize context-free languages â€” HTML being one example, due to its nested structure.

**ðŸš€ Features**
- PDA-based simulation for HTML tag validation
- Color-coded highlighting (valid/invalid tags, text)
- Real-time tag frequency and mismatch table
- Detailed mismatch reasons for easier debugging
- User-friendly modern GUI (with rounded buttons, Treeview table)
